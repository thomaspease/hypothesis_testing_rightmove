This notebook uses Pandas and SciPy to explore and perform hypothesis testing on commercial property data scraped from Rightmove.co.uk. The hypothesis which will be tested is that properties east of Greenwich (aka the Prime Meridian) are cheaper on average in terms of price/sq. ft. (Â£/ft2) than properties west of Greenwich.
